<h1>atelier 2 Deep learning</h1>
<H3>1. Establish a CNN Architecture (Based on Pytorch Library) to classify MINST Dataset, by
defining layers (Convolution, pooling, fully connect layer), the hyper-parameters (Kernels,
Padding , stride, optimizers, regularization, etc) and running the model in GPU mode.</H3>
